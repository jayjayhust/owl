# Out-of-the-Box Video Surveillance Platform

GoWVP is an open-source GB28181 solution implemented in Go, a network video platform based on the GB28181-2022 standard that also supports 2016/2011 versions, with ONVIF/RTMP/RTSP protocol support.

## Live Demo

|-|-|-|-|

## Use Cases

+ Browser-based camera video playback without plugins
+ Support for GB28181-compliant devices (IP cameras, platforms, NVRs, etc.)
+ Support for non-GB28181 devices (RTSP, RTMP, streaming devices, etc.) - maximize your existing equipment
+ Cross-network video preview
+ Deployment via Docker, Docker Compose, or Kubernetes

## Open Source Libraries

Thanks to @panjjo for the open-source library [panjjo/gosip](https://github.com/panjjo/gosip). GoWVP's SIP signaling is based on this library. Due to underlying encapsulation requirements, it's not a direct dependency but rather included in the pkg package.

Two streaming media servers are supported:

+ @夏楚 [ZLMediaKit](https://github.com/ZLMediaKit/ZLMediaKit)

+ **lalmax-pro** - For Go streaming media needs, contact email xx@golang.space
  - No environment requirements, no static library installation needed, cross-platform compilation support
  - Custom feature development available
  - G711 (G711A/G711U) to AAC transcoding support

Project framework based on @ixugo's [goddd](https://github.com/ixugo/goddd)

## FAQ

> Where are the frontend resources? How to load the web interface?

[Click to download www.zip package](https://github.com/gowvp/gb28181_web/releases/latest)

Download (packaged) frontend resources and place them in the project root directory, named `www` to load properly.

> Black screen when playing

Check "Quick Desktop" - "ZLM settings button (top right)" - "GB28181 stream receiving default address"
Ensure this address is accessible by the surveillance device.

Check "Quick Desktop" - "ZLM settings button (top right)" - "Hook IP"
Can ZLM access GoWVP? For Docker combined version, use 127.0.0.1. For separate deployment, use explicit IP address.

> Channel list shows fewer channels than actual count

By design. More than 4 channels should be viewed in the management page, or click "View More" on the right.

> Using nginx reverse proxy, returned playback addresses don't work or snapshots don't load

Configure the following parameters in reverse proxy (replace domain with your actual one):

proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Host $host;

proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Prefix "https://gowvp.com";

proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;

proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";

> How to use other databases?

In the `configs/config.toml` configuration file, modify `database.dsn`

[Recommended] SQLite should be a local disk path, default is `configs/data.db`

[Recommended] PostgreSQL format: `postgres://postgres:123456@127.0.0.1:5432/gb28181?sslmode=disable`

MySQL format: `mysql://root:123456@127.0.0.1:5432/gb28181?sslmode=disable`

PostgreSQL and MySQL format pattern:
`<db_type>://<username>:<password>@<ip>:<port>/<db_name>?sslmode=disable`

> How to disable AI?

AI detection is enabled by default, detecting 5 frames per second.

You can disable AI detection by setting `disabledAI = true` in `configs/config.toml`
